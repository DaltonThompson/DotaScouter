## What is Dota 2?
Dota 2 is a “multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA)” game in which two teams of five players choose unique “heroes” from a pool of 121.
## What is the origin of the Scouter?
This tool is inspired by others such as Dotapicker, DotaPlus for Overwolf, and Dotabuddy.
## Is there a desktop version that automatically updates player IDs?
This project is for browser first. A functional desktop version will be released shortly after the browser version is considered complete. Development will then focus on how to automatically update picks and bans.
## Notes
This program is subject to the status of multiple third-party APIs.
